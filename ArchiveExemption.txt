This repository should be exempt from archiving due to the way it is used.
It is used to create prototypes for eQ when needed which is not ongoing but is used as and when testing of a new feature or pattern is needed.
Also the designers that use this repo quite often create prototypes on branches that don't go on and then get merged into the main branch.
