<h1>How long have you lived at <em class="js-piped-answer" data-question-to-pipe="/prototypes/prodcom/dates.html">{x}</em>?</h1> <p>check the key stored in session and use it for the data-question-to-pipe attr with js-piped-answer class on html element youâ€™re replacing</p>
<p>Piping - this uses the data collected by the questions manager and pipes the answer into another page, e.g. into the wording of another question. To use it add the .js-piped-answer class to the element you want to pipe the answer into along with a {x} where in that element you want to pipe it. Then add the data-question-to-pipe attribute too and set it to the url of the page you want to pipe the answer from.</p>
