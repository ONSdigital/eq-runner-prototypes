    <p>In this section, we will ask you questions about products you have reported on in previous surveys.</p>
    <p>If some of your products are missing or described incorrectly, update the description and value in Section B.</p>

  <h3>Include:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>any production that was incorporated into the manufacture of other products</li>
        <li>sales of goods of your company produced that were invoiced during the period</li>
        <li>net value of trade and other discounts</li>
        <li>agents' commissions</li>
        <li>allowances on returns</li>
        <li>transfers of goods to other parts of the same organisation not covered by this return (value these as if sold to an independent customer)</li>
        <li>cost of packaging materials (minus allowances for returnable containers)</li>
        <li>sales of goods made for you under sub-contracting or toll manufacturing arrangements (such as work carried out by other firms or outworkers on materials supplied by you)</li>
        <li>free-on-board (FOB) value where goods have been exported

{{

        <p>It is calculated:</p>
        <p>Ex-factory price + other costs = FOB value</p>
        <p>‘Other costs’ in this calculation refers to the costs incurred in placing the goods in the ship for export. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>domestic transport costs</li>
            <li>storage and warehousing</li>
            <li>port handling</li>
            <li>brokerage fees</li>
            <li>service charges</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Production cost + Profit = Ex-Factory Price</p>"
    })
}}


        </li>
        <li>staged payments - where large constructions are invoiced in stages, the sales should be included as each stage is invoiced (volumes should be recorded on completion of the project)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exclude:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>goods produced during an earlier period even if you sold them during the period covered by this return</li>
        <li>VAT</li>
        <li>net proceeds from the sale of capital items</li>
        <li>all transport costs (where possible)</li>
